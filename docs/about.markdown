# About Me

My name is Yatin and I am a computer science student at the University of Georgia. My interests are programming, playing the guitar and the saxophone and I like to play pickle ball with my friends. I love to travel and explore the world as well.

This blog is dedicated to my ideas (good and bad ones) where I can put down my thoughts and inspire others' ideas as well.

If you are interested in contacting me the best way would be to send me a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yatin-kare/) request with a note and I hope to get in touch with you soon!
