Hello everyone visiting my page, if this is your first time looking at my blog, please check out my [About Me]({% link about.markdown %}) page.

Today I created 2 documents for my python project. I created a PRD document and TDD document. I used google docs and Gemini to help me create the initial template and check what I was missing or things I could improve on. I also used Perplexity Search with GPT-5 Thinking with researching topics like competitive analysis. I plan on finishing the TDD tomorrow and work on a architectural design document tomorrow. 

### Reflection
In my [previous post]({% link _posts/2025-10-23-first-post.markdown %}) I stated that this was my 3rd time starting over, and this time I wanted to do it correctly. I believed I was missing direction when I was trying create my solution the first 2 times and I got caught up in the smaller details. I'm not saying that it didn't work because in fact it worked well, but when I tried to add new features the code was too messy to debug and I was not able to fix issues that were breaking the program. By creating a PRD, TDD, and a architectural Design Document, I can focus on the important issues and create a task list that will give me a determined path towards the MVP.

If you are interested in viewing the documents here, are the links for the PRD and the TDD.
